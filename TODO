# Todo

* forking of timeline
* animate moves when forwarding rewinding time line
* mouse hover preview
* castling
* en passant
* promotion
* get better looking pieces
* parse and render pgn

## Done

* fix dragging pieces not animating (done)
* refactor: pass board top-left as a uniform for piece rendering so that 
    piece vertices do not have to be updated when moving a board (done)
* use gl_VertexID to eliminate the need for the piecesVertices buffer
    and instead use the board directly as the vertex buffer (done)
* refactor: pieces are not malloc'ed but live in the board pieces array so 
    than promotion can be implemented easily (done)
* make time marker thicker (done)
* animate time marker moving (done)
* use mouse click to navigate timeline (done)
* use geometry shader to generate 2 triangles that give a square based on coordinate, 
side length (done)
